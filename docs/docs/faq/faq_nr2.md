description: How to reduce the amount of sensor data
---

Depending on the configured **pulse rate**, the type of house/apartment and the heating system in use, the sensors that are exposed to Home Assistant may produce a lot of data. For example, with the default **pulse rate** of `1000`, a power consumption of 3600 W means that the sensors produce 2 HA state changes per second (which means 7200 state changes per hour).

If you don't need that kind of granularity, you can use [ESPHome sensor filters][filters] to reduce the rate of updates written to Home Assistant. With the commented-out filters in the [pulse_meter.yaml][file] enabled, only 396 state changes will be produced per hour. You can read more about making YAML adjustments on the [customizing the Firmware](/docs/advanced/firmware_customization.mdx) page.

### Pulse meter - power sensor

```yaml title="components/pulse_meter.yaml"
sensor:
  - platform: pulse_meter
    # ...
    filters:
      # multiply value = (60 / imp value) * 1000
      # - multiply: 60
      - lambda: return x * ((60.0 / id(select_pulse_rate).state) * 1000.0);

      # Update the sensor with an average every 10th second. See
      - throttle_average: 10s
      - filter_out: NaN
```

### Pulse meter - total energy sensor

```yaml title="components/pulse_meter.yaml"
sensor:
  - platform: total_daily_energy
    # ...
    filters:
      # multiply value = 1 / imp value
      # - multiply: 0.001
      - lambda: return x * (1.0 / id(select_pulse_rate).state);

      # Update the sensor once per 0.1 kWh consumed, or every 5th minute, whichever happens sooner.
      - delta: 0.01
      - heartbeat: 300s
```
